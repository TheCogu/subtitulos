[Adapted from the novel
"A City, Waiting for You" by Jiuyuexi]

00:01:33.164 --> 00:01:35.967
(Episode 20)

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:38.280
Dr Xu,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.638
what a coincidence,
running into you here.

00:01:40.638 --> 00:01:41.765
Yes.

00:01:43.407 --> 00:01:45.760
- It's a coincidence indeed.
- Are you guys out shopping too?

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.840
Yes, our daily supplies are running low,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.760
so we came out to buy some for everyone.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.053
It's about time.
Let's head back to the team.

00:01:51.053 --> 00:01:52.053
Yes, sir.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.076
You are strict in managing subordinates,
and I think that's fine.

00:01:57.255 --> 00:02:00.159
But doctors are hospital employees,

00:02:00.928 --> 00:02:03.027
not fire station employees.

00:02:03.027 --> 00:02:06.960
The medical rescue team is
a cooperating unit with you,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.414
your status are equal.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.280
So,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.838
let's waive those rules
that restrict personal freedom.

00:02:13.838 --> 00:02:15.120
Let's be more humane.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.262
Yan Chen...

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:18.709
I think...

00:02:19.313 --> 00:02:23.439
you won't just ignore what I said,
right, Captain Song?

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.680
Of course.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.680
That's a good suggestion.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.065
The more, the better.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.560
Take your time here.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.596
We'll head out first.
Yan Chen, let's go.

00:02:38.596 --> 00:02:40.159
Didn't I tell you?

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.680
Eat less junk food.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.240
Stay away from junk.

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:07.224
Yang Chi.

00:03:07.224 --> 00:03:09.527
- Yes, Captain.
- Do you want to eat it?

00:03:09.527 --> 00:03:11.245
- Yes.
- Just grab it then.

00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:12.948
Are you waiting for me to feed you?

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.599
Let's go.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.498
Dr Xu.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.285
It's time for you to return
from your purchasing trip.

00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:35.566
Time to return to the station.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.618
Yan Chen, I should return
to the fire station.

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:47.031
Didn't she take leave?

00:03:47.031 --> 00:03:49.080
Sorry, Mr Meng.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.108
When we go out,
there are time limits and regulations.

00:03:55.373 --> 00:03:56.677
I should get going.

00:04:03.488 --> 00:04:04.949
As for your feedback,

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.477
we will consider about it.

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.389
- Let's head back.
- Yes, sir.

[Searching for a parking space,
please drive forward]

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:55.439
Hello, Mum.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.809
Next time, give me a signal
in situations like this.

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:06.777
You surprised me just now.

00:05:06.777 --> 00:05:08.519
It's because you were slow.

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:11.649
Why didn't you tell us

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:14.000
that you went to the fire station
for training?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.018
Mum, this is for work.

00:05:16.018 --> 00:05:17.018
Did you...

00:05:17.688 --> 00:05:19.673
not take

00:05:19.673 --> 00:05:22.004
what I said seriously?

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:23.997
No, I didn't.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.169
Remember, come home this weekend.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.360
The eldest son of the Dong family

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.935
might come over for dinner.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.360
Mum, can't I...

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.759
Everything has been arranged.

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:37.633
Goodnight.

00:05:49.787 --> 00:05:51.399
Mum, I'm home.

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:52.720
Have you had dinner?

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.824
Yes.

00:05:53.824 --> 00:05:56.018
I came back to get some stuff.
I'm going home later.

00:05:56.018 --> 00:05:57.018
Wait.

00:05:58.362 --> 00:06:01.666
About your sister going
to the fire station for training,

00:06:01.666 --> 00:06:03.236
are you aware of it?

00:06:06.612 --> 00:06:07.612
Yes.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.800
You knew?

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.916
Since you knew,

00:06:12.916 --> 00:06:14.484
why didn't you stop her?

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:19.587
Is she getting involved
with Song Yan again?

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.279
They are not getting involved.

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.325
Meng Yan Chen,

00:06:27.325 --> 00:06:29.226
you're going too far.

00:06:29.226 --> 00:06:31.429
You're lying right to my face.

00:06:31.429 --> 00:06:32.546
Last time,

00:06:32.546 --> 00:06:34.199
you paid the fine for them.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:35.266
This time,

00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:38.439
you're hiding the fact
that she's at the fire station from me.

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:40.360
You keep covering for her.

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:42.306
Looks like

00:06:42.306 --> 00:06:45.242
I've given you too much freedom
and indulgence.

00:06:45.242 --> 00:06:47.612
Fine then. I'll find her a job

00:06:47.612 --> 00:06:49.639
at a university
or a pharmaceutical company.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:50.748
Mum,

00:06:50.748 --> 00:06:52.817
Qin Qin likes being a doctor.

00:06:52.817 --> 00:06:54.552
Please let her stay at the hospital.

00:06:54.552 --> 00:06:55.933
Mum...

00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:02.079
Deputy Director Liu,

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:04.612
I think this is really inappropriate.

00:07:04.612 --> 00:07:07.639
Allowing young nurses and doctors

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.240
to live at the fire station.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.319
I know, I know.

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:16.060
It's for work purposes.

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:18.199
Of course, I will support it.

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:20.545
But I think this kind of behaviour

00:07:20.545 --> 00:07:21.780
is inappropriate.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.364
Of course they have to leave.

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:27.759
Yes. They have to leave the station.

00:07:32.557 --> 00:07:33.791
[China Fire and Rescue]

00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:35.839
We are in the process
of adjusting and adapting.

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:38.980
If any issues arise,
we will make timely corrections.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.270
Yes. Thank you, Deputy Director Liu.

00:07:43.734 --> 00:07:44.831
What's wrong?

00:07:45.903 --> 00:07:47.738
They received a complaint
from a medical staff's family member,

00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:49.759
saying that they should move out
of the fire station.

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:52.671
We asked them to cooperate with us
in responding to emergencies.

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:56.839
Well, our response times
can be unpredictable,

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:58.515
standing by 24 hours a day.

00:07:58.515 --> 00:08:00.079
Their concerns are understandable.

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:01.331
What do you think?

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:06.090
Their request is reasonable.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.720
If they want to move out, that's fine.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.393
It's already commendable
that they were willing...

00:08:09.393 --> 00:08:11.401
to cooperate with us
in responding to emergencies.

00:08:11.401 --> 00:08:14.279
After all, doctors are not firefighters.

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:15.954
They have their own lives.

00:08:18.503 --> 00:08:20.104
There aren't many people.

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.973
Who could have filed the complaint?

00:08:28.858 --> 00:08:30.720
It couldn't be
Xu Qin's mother, could it?

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:34.367
She looked difficult to deal with.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240
Hi.

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:14.080
I've been thinking

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.299
that it's about time
you came to see me.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.520
Is this your idea of manners?

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.480
Considering our history,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.623
do you...

00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:33.146
really care about these trivial titles?

00:09:33.146 --> 00:09:34.146
Right.

00:09:35.586 --> 00:09:36.827
It was me who did it.

00:09:37.938 --> 00:09:39.104
I know.

00:09:39.647 --> 00:09:41.200
Besides you, no one else

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.713
could have done something like this.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.879
I thought you would come to see me.

00:09:45.879 --> 00:09:47.930
Actually, I was quite eager to meet you.

00:09:48.799 --> 00:09:50.120
Not for other reasons,

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.326
I was just curious about
what kind of person you are.

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:55.235
But then I thought,

00:09:56.048 --> 00:09:58.125
maybe you've been waiting
for me all along.

00:09:59.604 --> 00:10:01.044
So maybe I should wait a bit longer.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.008
You've matured.

00:10:05.008 --> 00:10:06.410
I have to thank you for that.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.246
After what I've gone through,

00:10:08.246 --> 00:10:09.762
I've become more mature.

00:10:12.783 --> 00:10:15.753
If you had been as composed back then,

00:10:15.753 --> 00:10:18.200
in front of your father's grave,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.039
I probably couldn't have done
anything to you.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.674
You can't do

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.239
anything to me now.

00:10:27.239 --> 00:10:28.364
Is that so?

00:10:29.266 --> 00:10:31.218
If I wanted to,

00:10:31.218 --> 00:10:32.705
it would be effortless.

00:10:34.172 --> 00:10:35.360
I'm begging you.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.274
Please spare my boy!
Don't ruin...

00:10:37.274 --> 00:10:38.679
Get him away from me.

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:40.411
I'm begging you, please spare our boy.

00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:42.120
Don't ruin his future.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.519
- Get him out of here.
- Please.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.000
Please spare our child.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.279
Please. Don't ruin his future.

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:51.519
Please! Please!

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:53.320
Please!

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.679
Please spare our boy.
Don't ruin his future.

00:10:56.679 --> 00:10:58.120
Please!

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.440
Please!

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.000
You can't just ruin our boy's future!

00:11:06.704 --> 00:11:08.715
Excuse me, here's your coffee.

00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:27.080
Leave my family alone.

00:11:30.306 --> 00:11:32.329
It's not ten years ago anymore.

00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:34.440
I'm not a kid anymore.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.240
If I really decide to fight,

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.698
I won't let you

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.680
get away unscathed.

00:11:40.871 --> 00:11:42.974
My father made you
feel quite challenged, didn't he?

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.411
I'm even tougher than him.

00:11:57.399 --> 00:11:58.399
Fine.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.253
You and Qin Qin

00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:02.716
should stop seeing each other.

00:12:07.231 --> 00:12:08.619
Are you afraid of me that much?

00:12:08.619 --> 00:12:09.619
No.

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:12.236
You're just not worthy.

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:26.879
Song Yan,

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:28.305
to be honest,

00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:31.159
I used to admire your father.

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:33.679
He was an upright man,

00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:34.879
but...

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.639
he didn't know how to be flexible.

00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:38.360
He was careless in his choice of friends.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.729
And you...

00:12:41.532 --> 00:12:43.365
Don't you have any self-respect?

00:12:44.034 --> 00:12:45.793
With so many conflicts

00:12:45.793 --> 00:12:47.600
between our families,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.146
how can you still like Qin Qin?

00:12:50.146 --> 00:12:51.576
I don't even know

00:12:52.845 --> 00:12:54.645
if you have any ulterior motives.

00:12:56.013 --> 00:12:57.214
Maybe

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.878
you're just...

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:02.960
like your mother.

00:13:04.021 --> 00:13:05.840
Our values are different,

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.446
there's nothing more to talk about.

00:13:08.225 --> 00:13:09.845
In your eyes,

00:13:09.845 --> 00:13:12.000
people are divided into different ranks.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.279
In my eyes,

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:14.685
everyone is equal.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.913
I have never tried

00:13:17.913 --> 00:13:19.664
to please anyone in my life,

00:13:20.404 --> 00:13:22.265
nor have I looked down on anyone,

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.376
but I look down on you.

00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:47.879
What a pity.

00:13:51.736 --> 00:13:53.022
Pay attention to your posture!

00:13:54.004 --> 00:13:55.632
Move forward!

00:13:55.632 --> 00:13:57.054
Hold it farther away.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.167
Hold it.

00:14:03.347 --> 00:14:04.474
Stop.

00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:07.184
Vice Captain Yang,

00:14:07.184 --> 00:14:10.720
we have never tried this water gun.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.484
Can we try it?

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:15.320
I'm not sure about that.
You girls don't have much strength.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.893
This has quite a kick.

00:14:16.893 --> 00:14:20.639
We're actually pretty strong.

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:22.240
Just let us give it a try.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.961
We'll be leaving soon anyway.

00:14:25.159 --> 00:14:26.903
Well, all right.

00:14:26.903 --> 00:14:28.840
I'll let you have a go.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.407
- Take a break, guys.
- Yes, sir.

00:14:30.407 --> 00:14:32.452
Take off two suits
of clothes and helmets.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.120
- Come with me.
- Okay.

00:14:41.667 --> 00:14:42.567
Hi, Nan.

00:14:42.567 --> 00:14:44.452
Dr Xu, take a picture of me.

00:14:44.452 --> 00:14:45.523
Okay.

00:14:45.523 --> 00:14:46.623
Hold it under your arm.

00:14:46.623 --> 00:14:47.879
One leg front, the other back.

00:14:47.879 --> 00:14:49.159
One leg front, the other back. Got it?

00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:50.293
- Got it.
- Bend a little.

00:14:50.293 --> 00:14:51.852
Make sure to hold it tightly.
The pressure is really strong.

00:14:51.852 --> 00:14:53.530
- Okay.
- Turn on the water.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.759
- Okay.
- Lower the water pressure.

00:14:55.759 --> 00:14:57.960
Wait a moment

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.320
- and pull it backward to release it.
- Okay.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.559
- Ready?
- Yes!

00:15:00.559 --> 00:15:02.073
- Open the water!
- I...

00:15:02.073 --> 00:15:03.451
Here we go, Dong Dong.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.852
Three, two, one.

00:15:15.119 --> 00:15:16.959
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay, Dr Xu?

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:18.240
Are you okay, Dr Xu?

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.080
Careful, guys.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.198
Take a look at it.

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:54.659
Put your clothes on before you come out.

00:16:25.159 --> 00:16:27.364
Hair dryer. Dry your hair. Don't catch a cold.

00:16:48.039 --> 00:16:50.679
Your hands that are holding
the surgical knife is so clumsy, Dr. Xu.

00:16:50.679 --> 00:16:51.945
How strange.

00:16:52.559 --> 00:16:54.720
It's because your sleeves
are too long and baggy,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.277
hindering my movement.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.380
Sit down.

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:24.472
My hair's getting all tangled up.

00:17:26.399 --> 00:17:27.827
Do you still want my help?

00:17:32.359 --> 00:17:33.658
Why are you laughing?

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.820
You look like a ghost.

00:17:39.262 --> 00:17:41.532
You turned me into a ghost.

00:18:50.834 --> 00:18:52.359
Here.

00:18:52.359 --> 00:18:54.600
Don't catch a cold.
Take a hot shower.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.200
Aren't your aunt and uncle here?

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.426
If I'm in the middle of a shower, and
they come in, won't they catch me?

00:19:16.279 --> 00:19:17.532
All right. Go on.

00:19:19.739 --> 00:19:20.992
I'll wait outside.

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:36.932
Song Yan,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.525
where's the hair dryer?

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.566
How long have you been a firefighter?

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:17.646
A long time.

00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.069
So,

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.576
you were in the army before?

00:21:25.423 --> 00:21:26.790
Right.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.279
You said back then that you wanted
to apply to a military academy.

00:21:29.279 --> 00:21:32.015
I didn't perform well in my second college
entrance examination either. I messed it up.

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:36.240
Don't over think it.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.160
It had nothing to do with you leaving.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.928
I was never cut out for academics.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.009
But I remember
when you repeated the year,

00:21:45.009 --> 00:21:47.079
you made significant progress.

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:48.503
You remember it wrong.

00:21:53.119 --> 00:21:54.865
Okay, it's almost dried.

00:22:03.119 --> 00:22:06.299
Why do I get the feeling
you're not telling me the truth?

00:22:07.079 --> 00:22:08.440
Song Yan?

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.779
What truth?

00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:14.781
I want to know everything about you
after we separated.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.346
Can't you tell me?

00:22:22.145 --> 00:22:24.119
Yes, I can't.

00:22:24.119 --> 00:22:25.383
Why?

00:22:27.784 --> 00:22:29.480
That's my own business.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.199
It has nothing to do with you.

00:22:34.026 --> 00:22:35.599
Nothing to do with me?

00:22:37.195 --> 00:22:38.728
Are you serious?

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.993
Then what's the point of me
coming to the fire station this time?

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:44.532
If that's what you were thinking,
then you shouldn't have come.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.804
Did you not want me to come?

00:22:47.804 --> 00:22:49.421
It has nothing to do with that.

00:22:50.006 --> 00:22:52.119
Then what does it have to do with?

00:22:52.119 --> 00:22:54.319
We have missed ten years.

00:22:54.319 --> 00:22:56.872
I want to fill in the gaps
of these ten years.

00:23:07.558 --> 00:23:09.044
Why bother, Xu Qin?

00:23:10.839 --> 00:23:12.801
The time that has been missed is gone.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:17.099
It cannot be made up just because
you wish to piece it together.

00:23:18.752 --> 00:23:20.960
Why cling to the past and not let go?

00:23:22.005 --> 00:23:23.612
You said

00:23:23.612 --> 00:23:25.547
we need time

00:23:25.547 --> 00:23:26.906
to get to know each other.

00:23:27.693 --> 00:23:29.400
We can reacquaint ourselves,

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.298
see if the person before us now

00:23:34.972 --> 00:23:36.749
can make our hearts flutter,

00:23:37.547 --> 00:23:38.996
if we still like them,

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.344
and if we want
to be together again.

00:23:42.959 --> 00:23:46.798
But the person standing in front of me has
also gone through the past to come to me.

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:48.920
I want to know

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.417
what you have gone through
in these ten years.

00:23:52.268 --> 00:23:54.505
I want to know about your past.

00:23:54.505 --> 00:23:56.465
Is... Is that wrong?

00:24:00.378 --> 00:24:03.119
You can find out about my past, Dr Xu.

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:06.123
But what is

00:24:07.885 --> 00:24:09.318
our relationship now?

00:24:12.522 --> 00:24:13.672
Are we friends?

00:24:14.992 --> 00:24:16.225
Lovers?

00:24:19.398 --> 00:24:21.139
With what identity do you want to

00:24:22.472 --> 00:24:24.166
delve into my past?

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.846
Song Yan,

00:24:29.506 --> 00:24:31.466
are you trying
to set boundaries with me?

00:24:32.599 --> 00:24:33.963
Are you saying

00:24:35.119 --> 00:24:36.671
that if we're just friends,

00:24:38.359 --> 00:24:39.719
I've crossed the line?

00:24:50.839 --> 00:24:52.205
I don't know...

00:24:53.279 --> 00:24:55.687
I don't know how things between us

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.943
have reached this dead end today.

00:25:02.006 --> 00:25:03.465
Dead end...

00:25:08.779 --> 00:25:10.459
Maybe if we see each other less,

00:25:11.347 --> 00:25:13.240
not see each other at all,

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.620
keep our distance,

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.241
things will get better.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.069
You're right.

00:25:22.859 --> 00:25:24.577
We should keep our distance.

00:25:27.079 --> 00:25:29.151
It was my one-sided wishful thinking.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.292
It's all my own problem.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.114
I'm sorry.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.209
It'll be over after today.

00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:42.736
In the future,

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.718
we'll have fewer opportunities to meet.

00:25:47.039 --> 00:25:48.419
That's for the best.

00:25:49.026 --> 00:25:50.414
Are you saying

00:25:52.366 --> 00:25:54.155
that after today,

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.750
we'll never see each other again?

00:26:11.079 --> 00:26:12.359
I see.

00:26:14.243 --> 00:26:16.053
So, the gift you gave me

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.801
carries this meaning.

00:26:24.253 --> 00:26:25.673
Thank you.

00:26:28.359 --> 00:26:30.047
I wish you all the best,

00:26:31.759 --> 00:26:33.053
Captain Song.

00:27:14.279 --> 00:27:16.960
Dr Xu, you just got drenched. Have some.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.680
What if you get sick tomorrow?

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.839
It's hot. Careful.

00:27:19.839 --> 00:27:21.242
You made this?

00:27:21.878 --> 00:27:25.281
Have some. I have to take care
of you for the sake of everyone.

00:27:25.281 --> 00:27:26.385
Thank you.

00:27:26.385 --> 00:27:28.319
Can I go back to the hospital first?

00:27:28.319 --> 00:27:30.760
Of course not. You are our team leader.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.552
It wouldn't look good if you didn't go.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.593
Finish it.

00:27:35.593 --> 00:27:36.912
Let's go there later.

00:27:51.599 --> 00:27:52.720
I was looking for you.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.767
Let's go. It's the farewell dinner.

00:27:56.312 --> 00:27:57.899
What farewell dinner?

00:27:57.899 --> 00:27:59.119
Dr Xu and the others have arrived.

00:27:59.119 --> 00:28:01.129
We're having a farewell dinner.

00:28:02.251 --> 00:28:04.120
- My stomach is upset.
- Don't give me that.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.880
You're the captain.
How can you not attend the dinner?

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.000
Let's go. Hurry up. Come on. Let's go.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.346
Guys, I'd like to propose a toast.

00:28:13.573 --> 00:28:17.039
Shouldn't we toast the medical staff?

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:18.279
You've worked so hard!

00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:21.376
- Raise your glasses!
- Good job!

00:28:25.519 --> 00:28:27.210
As the medical team,

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.839
we should also thank you
for taking care of us during this time.

00:28:29.839 --> 00:28:31.881
- Thank you.
- That's too formal.

00:28:31.881 --> 00:28:34.951
We're all part of the same team.
We're one family now.

00:28:34.951 --> 00:28:36.120
Do visit often.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.119
- You too, Nan.
- Okay, we will.

00:28:38.119 --> 00:28:39.789
I will visit often.

00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:41.324
I'll bring my son with me next time.

00:28:41.324 --> 00:28:44.005
What? You have a son, Bei?

00:28:44.005 --> 00:28:45.828
- No, no.
- You look so young.

00:28:45.828 --> 00:28:47.600
Like you just graduated
from the nursing school.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.399
No, no. I meant my godson.

00:28:50.333 --> 00:28:51.920
Still, you are very young
to be a godmother.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.278
Do you have a son, Nan?

00:28:54.338 --> 00:28:56.778
Pi Pi, that's none of your concern.

00:28:57.359 --> 00:28:59.677
Dr Li, you're so fair-skinned,
surely there are men pursuing you.

00:28:59.677 --> 00:29:00.716
I think so too.

00:29:01.519 --> 00:29:04.359
Don't start gossips.
I don't have any suitors.

00:29:04.359 --> 00:29:06.082
When I have time off,

00:29:06.082 --> 00:29:08.319
my mum keeps arranging
blind dates for me.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.559
Forget about me.

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:13.189
You guys shouldn't have any
problems finding a girlfriend, right?

00:29:13.189 --> 00:29:16.480
They say the most handsome ones
are already dedicated to the country.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.240
Actually, it's strange.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.039
Those of us who have partners
in the station are all quiet types.

00:29:21.039 --> 00:29:23.480
I mean, look at Yi, Ge,

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.480
Yuan Hai, Liu Kai.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.240
They are all quiet types. Right, Ge?

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.797
Why do you still talk so much then?

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.541
If that's the case,

00:29:32.541 --> 00:29:33.922
your captain is the quietest.

00:29:33.922 --> 00:29:35.286
Does he have a girlfriend too?

00:29:36.812 --> 00:29:40.852
Dong Dong, you don't know this,
but our captain is quite devoted.

00:29:40.852 --> 00:29:43.235
He has been waiting for
his first love for ten years.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.759
Really?

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:52.440
I heard it from Yi.

00:29:53.759 --> 00:29:55.900
Come on, man. Don't sell me out.

00:29:56.525 --> 00:29:58.832
Captain, you're so romantic.

00:29:58.832 --> 00:30:02.279
So there really are people who are
deeply devoted and romantic like this.

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:04.273
- Tell us about it, Captain.
- Tell us now.

00:30:04.273 --> 00:30:06.559
Jiang Yi was just talking nonsense.
There's nothing like that.

00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:08.000
Go back to eating your food now.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.079
Captain, there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

00:30:10.079 --> 00:30:12.232
- Our veteran team members all know it.
- That's right.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.160
Let me vouch for Jiang.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.480
What Jiang Yi said is true.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.920
That's enough. Stop being nosy.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.903
So, where is that girl now?

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.716
I'm curious.

00:30:26.998 --> 00:30:28.259
She's abroad.

00:30:29.765 --> 00:30:33.169
Does she know that you've always
liked her and are still waiting for her?

00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:35.919
Whether she knows or not
doesn't really matter.

00:30:35.919 --> 00:30:37.466
We won't be together anyway.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.312
It's been so many years,
and people change.

00:30:41.312 --> 00:30:43.958
Some feelings don't need to be forced.

00:30:44.582 --> 00:30:47.359
Having memories and being well apart

00:30:47.359 --> 00:30:48.559
is the best outcome.

00:30:49.554 --> 00:30:51.887
That's such a pity.

00:30:51.887 --> 00:30:54.034
That's right, Captain.
Don't you think it's a pity?

00:30:54.034 --> 00:30:55.493
In life,

00:30:55.493 --> 00:30:57.259
there are always a few things to regret.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.960
Yes.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.240
I have regrets too.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.607
For example, this joint rescue team

00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:05.671
didn't meet my expectations.

00:31:05.671 --> 00:31:07.250
I feel a bit regretful about that.

00:31:07.939 --> 00:31:10.639
Don't say that.
We've learned a lot here.

00:31:10.639 --> 00:31:11.750
That's right.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.309
It's been a real eye opener.

00:31:13.309 --> 00:31:16.414
If I hadn't come, I wouldn't have known
that firefighters have to do so many things.

00:31:16.414 --> 00:31:18.279
That's because of the restructuring.

00:31:18.279 --> 00:31:20.240
Now, fire incidents,

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.653
disaster response, and social emergencies

00:31:22.653 --> 00:31:25.626
of all kinds fall under our responsibility.

00:31:26.539 --> 00:31:28.240
All I know is that
after the restructuring,

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.226
our management has
become more military-like.

00:31:30.226 --> 00:31:31.827
We have more opportunities to go out.

00:31:31.827 --> 00:31:33.929
Yes, and the benefits
have improved a lot too.

00:31:33.929 --> 00:31:35.582
If they could be further
enhanced in the future,

00:31:35.582 --> 00:31:37.333
- that would be even better.
- It's not about the benefits.

00:31:37.333 --> 00:31:38.740
We are here to serve the people.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.918
Yes, to serve the people.

00:31:39.918 --> 00:31:41.359
Yes, yes.

00:31:42.505 --> 00:31:46.526
Indeed. What you're doing
deserves even more rewards.

00:31:47.309 --> 00:31:48.812
The restructuring is a good thing.

00:31:48.812 --> 00:31:50.039
Yes,

00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:53.266
it's more professional, meticulous,
and career-oriented.

00:31:53.266 --> 00:31:55.480
Those of us who are part of it

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.013
feel that it's a good thing.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.267
I hope our working environment and systems
can also undergo some changes.

00:32:01.267 --> 00:32:04.039
Actually, I think your work
is quite challenging too.

00:32:04.039 --> 00:32:07.319
Yes, but in comparison,
your job is tougher.

00:32:08.299 --> 00:32:10.960
Actually, I really dislike
the words "heroism",

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.480
"sentiment", "dedication",
and "sacrifice."

00:32:14.672 --> 00:32:18.319
These words shouldn't be associated
with any specific profession.

00:32:18.319 --> 00:32:20.365
A profession should be
just a profession itself.

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:26.737
What does that mean?

00:32:27.619 --> 00:32:29.185
In society,

00:32:29.185 --> 00:32:31.387
no job should be fueled by love.

00:32:31.387 --> 00:32:34.590
The public shouldn't demand any group
of people to sacrifice themselves.

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.125
A profession is just a profession.

00:32:36.125 --> 00:32:38.880
It can have responsibilities
and a sense of mission,

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.020
but fundamentally, it's just a job.

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:44.720
It doesn't need to be adorned
with a divine or heroic halo.

00:32:45.799 --> 00:32:47.180
We are all ordinary people.

00:32:47.759 --> 00:32:50.855
You should receive rewards
according to the value you create.

00:32:51.819 --> 00:32:53.409
Apart from that,

00:32:53.409 --> 00:32:56.698
we shouldn't burden the profession
with too many extra things,

00:32:56.698 --> 00:32:58.998
especially grand theories and grandiose ideals.

00:33:01.119 --> 00:33:03.559
Are you denying the halo
associated with our profession?

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.495
I just think
that it shouldn't be like that.

00:33:07.091 --> 00:33:08.533
Shouldn't be like how?

00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:14.465
Never mind, you wouldn't understand.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.046
Let's just eat.

00:33:25.851 --> 00:33:27.519
You think we're all living in

00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:29.571
a delusional dream of being a hero?

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.880
Actually,

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.319
I think this...

00:33:37.359 --> 00:33:39.578
Dr Xu, come out with me for a second.

00:33:44.693 --> 00:33:46.330
- Captain.
- Dr Xu.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:47.640
Dr Xu...

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.771
- Chi, maybe I should go after them.
- Sit down.

00:33:50.633 --> 00:33:53.146
There are so many dishes.
Don't waste them.

00:33:53.146 --> 00:33:54.598
Stay out of it.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.724
Let's eat.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.713
Do you think

00:34:13.289 --> 00:34:14.840
that the people inside,

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.159
your colleagues,

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:17.593
my friends,

00:34:17.593 --> 00:34:19.128
are like fools,

00:34:19.128 --> 00:34:22.398
that we relied on these delusional dreams
of being heroes to self-hypnotize ourselves

00:34:22.398 --> 00:34:24.672
and choose this profession,
persisting in it until now?

00:34:24.672 --> 00:34:26.537
You know that's not what I meant.

00:34:26.537 --> 00:34:27.897
I know what you mean.

00:34:29.231 --> 00:34:30.479
You've always been smart.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:33.802
You're so smart
that everyone is a fool in your eyes,

00:34:34.779 --> 00:34:35.866
including me.

00:34:35.866 --> 00:34:37.920
Why are you getting angry with me?

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.851
What I said isn't wrong, is it?

00:34:39.851 --> 00:34:41.219
Yes.

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:43.145
Your words truly match your character.

00:34:43.145 --> 00:34:44.353
Really,

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.894
Xu Qin,

00:34:50.962 --> 00:34:52.474
you're still the same as before,

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.212
never owing anyone anything

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:58.625
and never allowing anyone
to take even a bit more from you.

00:34:58.625 --> 00:35:01.026
So, I can't discuss things
objectively, is that it?

00:35:01.704 --> 00:35:03.505
What kind of objectivity
are you talking about?

00:35:03.505 --> 00:35:06.085
There are many professions
in this society.

00:35:06.085 --> 00:35:08.310
Every occupation has its own difficulties.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:11.438
Everyone involved in their respective
profession faces their own challenges.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.800
You think sanitation workers' works are easy?

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.184
You think teachers' works are easy?

00:35:15.184 --> 00:35:16.452
That police officers' works are easy?

00:35:16.452 --> 00:35:18.726
What about those involved in
infrastructure or border defense?

00:35:18.726 --> 00:35:22.000
There are certain special professions
that involve public service

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.466
and social care.

00:35:23.466 --> 00:35:25.033
They can't be simply...

00:35:26.159 --> 00:35:27.599
be defined by money.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.171
Every profession is gradually improving,

00:35:33.171 --> 00:35:34.760
gradually changing.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.206
It's the efforts and actions

00:35:37.206 --> 00:35:40.480
of individuals within those professions,
not just empty words.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.519
We face so many things every day.

00:35:44.099 --> 00:35:45.119
Things.

00:35:46.119 --> 00:35:47.119
Xu Qin,

00:35:50.403 --> 00:35:52.119
you only see things in your eyes,

00:35:53.679 --> 00:35:55.047
without any sentiment.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.400
Do you love your profession?

00:36:11.079 --> 00:36:12.880
Do you love yours then?

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.880
I do.

00:36:16.159 --> 00:36:17.371
Not just me,

00:36:17.913 --> 00:36:19.114
Jiang Yu,

00:36:19.114 --> 00:36:21.199
Yang Chi, Jiang Yi and the others,
we all love our job.

00:36:21.199 --> 00:36:23.717
And I believe your colleagues,
Li Nan and Xu Xi, love their job too.

00:36:25.079 --> 00:36:26.409
You must think

00:36:27.639 --> 00:36:28.922
we are fools.

00:36:37.566 --> 00:36:39.280
Do you know

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.547
there are three words called
"I am willing"?

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.840
These words are priceless.

00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:50.299
But there are some people

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.852
who are like fools.

00:36:53.792 --> 00:36:55.599
When they look at things,

00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:56.854
they see the sentiment.

00:36:56.854 --> 00:36:58.687
[Braving The Fire and The Danger,
Always Ready to Fight and Win]

00:36:58.687 --> 00:37:00.840
They are willing to be angels,

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.240
to be heroes,

00:37:03.085 --> 00:37:05.965
to selflessly dedicate themselves
without asking for anything in return.

00:37:07.765 --> 00:37:09.662
You have no right to look down on them.

00:37:11.353 --> 00:37:13.361
I'm not looking down on anyone.

00:37:13.361 --> 00:37:16.241
- I just want to tell you rationally...
- Your rationality is condescending

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.364
and cruel.

00:37:21.167 --> 00:37:22.525
It's extremely inappropriate

00:37:23.239 --> 00:37:24.480
for today.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.280
Goodbye,

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:36.559
Dr Xu.

00:37:49.559 --> 00:37:50.599
Song Yan,

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.599
you've misunderstood me.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.360
I just don't want to see you

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.639
taking such risks for your beliefs.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.029
I don't want your profession
to become a burden on your shoulders.

00:40:47.549 --> 00:40:50.199
Yang, where is the gift
you prepared for Nurse Xu Xi?

00:40:50.199 --> 00:40:51.455
I got it.

00:40:51.455 --> 00:40:52.840
Just shut up.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.519
Nurse Xi, this is for you.

00:40:54.519 --> 00:40:56.280
I know you really love to drink this,
so I bought this for you.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.760
Let me know when you finish it,

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.159
- and I'll get you more. No worries.
- I don't have any gifts for you.

00:40:59.159 --> 00:41:00.599
I wish you well at work.

00:41:00.599 --> 00:41:02.400
Okay. Remember to wash your clothes well.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.880
- I will.
- Okay, I'm going now.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.506
- Okay, okay.
- Instructor,

00:41:07.239 --> 00:41:08.559
I need to ask you a favour.

00:41:08.559 --> 00:41:10.205
What is it, Dr Xu?

00:41:10.205 --> 00:41:14.245
Can you help me apologize
to everyone for what happened earlier?

00:41:14.245 --> 00:41:16.073
Sometimes, I don't express myself well.

00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:17.566
I really didn't mean that.

00:41:17.566 --> 00:41:18.620
I know.

00:41:19.317 --> 00:41:22.772
You two were just caught up in the moment.

00:41:22.772 --> 00:41:24.199
Don't take it to heart.

00:41:24.199 --> 00:41:25.988
Dr Xu, don't over think it.

00:41:25.988 --> 00:41:28.357
We all know you didn't mean it that way.

00:41:28.357 --> 00:41:30.392
I know you're worried about us.

00:41:30.392 --> 00:41:31.760
We've spent so much time together.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.960
How could we not know
what kind of person you are?

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.112
Captain is probably not
in a good mood today.

00:41:36.112 --> 00:41:37.597
Don't take it to heart.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.819
I'm leaving now.

00:41:40.769 --> 00:41:41.967
Have a safe journey.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.039
Are you reluctant to leave?

00:41:50.039 --> 00:41:51.480
You want to stay, huh?

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.239
Bye.
